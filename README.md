# ebookSorter

This program is supposed to list eboks that are in a folder and get the author, the name of the book, rating, genres and link for further information (it gets this from goodreads). And the tranfere the data to an excel document so it is easy to sort the books by genre, author and rating. 

I found that this program has som issues...
 -For example some of the books get no rating, this is beacuse the method for getting the name from the filename of the ebook fails.
    ->More methods are needed, so it can take more books
    ->A better system for choosing method
 -Also some books get confused with others so the rating is wrong... And the link
    ->Some test checking if the book is the rigth one
  
But overall the program succed on most books. It is wery useful if anyone happens to have a foulder filled with  ebooks. With some; No, a lot of tweaking this program should work for movies. (using idmb for rating and info, and changing the methods, basicly the hole program)
